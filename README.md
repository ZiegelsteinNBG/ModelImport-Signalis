# ModelImport-Signalis[WIP]
Everything is currently WIP: scripts, mod, guide...

This mod allows importing custom models into Signalis by loading AssetBundles.

## Model export guide
Please read this guide carefully. If you have any difficulties understanding specific steps or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to post an issue on GitHub or contact me on Discord (user: ziegelstein).

### Requirements:
- [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html)
- [Required Version of Unity 2020.3.36](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.36#release-notes)
- [AssetBundleBuilder Script](https://github.com/ZiegelsteinNBG/ModelImport-Signalis/tree/main/AssetBundle%20Scripts)
- Your AssetBundle must contain both your model and the metarig. The metarig should be named exactly as in the example AssetBundle and must have the same bone count to ensure compatibility.
- Import the AssetBundleExample into your Unity project along with the AssetLoaderScript to understand the correct structure and setup.
- [Recommended] Before using it in the mod, test your AssetBundle by importing it into a new Unity project with the same Unity version as required.
