# ModelImport-Signalis[WIP]
Everything is currently WIP: scripts, mod, guide...
This mod allows importing custom models into Signalis by loading AssetBundles.

## Model export guide


### Requirements:
- [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html)
- [Required Version of Unity](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.36#release-notes)
- [AssetBundle Export Script](https://github.com/ZiegelsteinNBG/ModelImport-Signalis/tree/main/AssetBundle%20Scripts)
- Your AssetBundle must contain both your model and the metarig. The metarig should be named exactly as in the example AssetBundle and must have the same bone count to ensure compatibility.
